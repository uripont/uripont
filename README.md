*I am Oriol, a creative on a mission to solve meaningful hard problems at scale. In short, I work to enable, ship, and accelerate positive-sum, asymmetric impact.*

Grew up making [games](https://uripont.github.io/early-games-guide/), which helps explain why I study both Math Engineering and Computer Science at UPF.

Breadth-explored software engineering, AI, product development, gamification, and tech startups for the last few years. It was done through some [initial side projects](https://uripont.github.io/early-side-projects-guide) and [open demos](https://github.com/stars/uripont/lists/open-demo-projects).

Currently interested in AGI, distributed stateful serverless runtimes, universal interfaces, full-stack type-safe programming, OSS, 3D animation and autonomous agents. I expect to focus on these areas in the coming years.
